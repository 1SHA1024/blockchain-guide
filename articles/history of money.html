    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br/> It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
    storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br/> HTML 
    describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
    included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br/> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br/> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page.<br/> Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.<br/> Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
    
    
    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br/> Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),<br/> former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,<br/> has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
